# scripts/smoke.sh — Brutal Honesty Rulebook v3.3 Rule 5 smoke gate.
#
# Single deterministic smoke command. Exercises the production code path end-to-end.
# Returns 0 only if every check it ran passed.
#
# Honest disclosure (built into the script's output):
#   - Stage 1 (API / surface boot): always runs. Validates the application stack
#     can construct (whatever "the application" is in your repo — FastAPI app,
#     Django settings, CLI argument parser, etc.). The default invocation runs
#     `pytest tests/test_e2e_smoke.py -x` — replace with your own surface check
#     if you do not have that file.
#   - Stage 2 (production-pipeline import + minimal exercise): runs ONLY if your
#     production deps are importable. If they are not, Stage 2 is reported as
#     SKIPPED with a clear reason — and the script EXITS NON-ZERO because Rule 5
#     demands an actual end-to-end production-path verification.
#
# Two-tier framing per v3.3 Rule 5 (§1 + §10):
#   - Floor: import + surface-check through production code paths (what the
#     reference smoke_pipeline.py.template emits). Acceptable for a v3.2 minimum.
#   - Ceiling: true end-to-end against a real fixture (your real OCR/web/CLI
#     entry point producing a real output that downstream consumers depend on).
#     This is the target. Until you reach ceiling, your PR body's SMOKE: line
#     MUST name the tier you ran AND any ceiling gap MUST appear as a Carried
#     Debt entry in your next-session.md.
#
# Use:
#   bash scripts/smoke.sh                 # full local smoke
#   bash scripts/smoke.sh --api-only      # only Stage 1 (CI use, docs-only PRs)
#   bash scripts/smoke.sh --skip-stage2   # alias for --api-only

# BHS v3.3 integration note (added 2026-05-15 during reconciliation):
# This script is the canonical smoke gate. It should eventually call
# validate_pr_brutal_honesty + run_smoke_pipeline for any changed planning docs,
# AEP cycles, or computational storage artifacts.
# Current state: Real BHS v3.3 scripts exist in this directory. Full wiring into
# the AEP orchestrator and CI is in progress (see reconciliation backlog).
#
# The --api-only / --skip-stage2 flags exist to let docs-only PRs (and pre-deploy
# check-the-API CI jobs) run a partial smoke. v3.2 §4 PR template requires that
# any "complete" PR's SMOKE: line includes the FULL output (not the partial one)
# OR explicitly calls out that this PR is docs-only and Stage 2 was intentionally
# skipped — and even then, the script EXITS NON-ZERO so the skip is visible.

set -u  # treat unset vars as errors; do NOT set -e (we handle errors explicitly)
