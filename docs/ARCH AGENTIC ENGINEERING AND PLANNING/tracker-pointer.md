# Active Tracker Pointer

Purpose: Keep a single canonical link to the current tracker to reduce context churn.

## Current Tracker
- `docs/ARCH AGENTIC ENGINEERING AND PLANNING/backlog-2026-02-13.md`

## Last Updated
- 2026-02-17

## Cycle ID
- AEP-2026-02-13

Consistency rule:
- Cycle ID must match the cycle-id used in the backlog index and scope lock record.
- Pointer updates are owned by the cycle owner in the tracker index.

## Verification Log Path
- `docs/ARCH AGENTIC ENGINEERING AND PLANNING/session-log-2026-02-17-impl-7.md`

Note:
- Per-cycle logs are default. Use legacy logs only when cycle layout is not used.
