# Session Log -- Implementation 4

Cycle ID: `AEP-2026-02-13`  
Session Date: `2026-02-17`  
Mode: Agent-orchestrated implementation with fresh sub-agents per finding

## Objectives
- Implement and validate top next findings:
  - `F-031`, `F-032`, `F-033`, `F-035`, `F-043`
- Prevent context drift via orchestration + structured handoff docs.

## Agent Orchestration Record
- Research pass: `researcher` agent produced implementation-ready mapping across all 5 findings.
- Architecture pass: `architect` agent produced minimal-change blueprint and execution order.
- Implementation passes (`implementer`, fresh instance each):
  - F-032
  - F-035
  - F-031
  - F-033
  - F-043
- Manual cleanup/verification:
  - Removed non-essential helper artifacts generated by sub-agents.
  - Fixed minor test issues introduced during agent runs.
  - Re-ran focused and full regression suites.

## Findings Resolved This Session
- **F-031**: Payload caching path added for sedimentation sync to avoid duplicate payload retrieval.
- **F-032**: `ChelationLogger` duplicate file writes removed; file logging now single JSON write path.
- **F-033**: `parallel_revalidation()` now executes concurrent finding processing with resilient error logging.
- **F-035**: Ollama embed path now normalizes output to stable `np.float32` arrays.
- **F-043**: `CheckpointManager`/`SafeTrainingContext` integrated into both sedimentation workflows.

## Tests Added/Updated
- `test_chelation_logger.py`
  - Added JSON-line validity coverage for logger file output.
- `test_antigravity_engine.py`
  - Added/updated Ollama dtype consistency coverage.
  - Added checkpoint integration coverage for sedimentation workflow.
- `test_sedimentation_trainer.py`
  - Added payload-map (skip retrieve) and backward-compatible retrieve-path tests.
- `test_aep_orchestrator.py`
  - Added parallel revalidation enrichment and exception-handling coverage.
- `test_recursive_decomposer.py`
  - Added hierarchical checkpoint integration coverage.

## Validation Evidence
- Focused suites run during implementation:
  - `python -m pytest test_chelation_logger.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest test_antigravity_engine.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest test_sedimentation_trainer.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest test_aep_orchestrator.py -q`
  - `python -m pytest test_checkpoint_manager.py test_antigravity_engine.py test_recursive_decomposer.py -q`
- Final regression:
  - `python -m pytest (Get-ChildItem -Name test_*.py) -q`
  - Result: `357 passed, 1 warning`

## Net Backlog Impact
- Previously resolved: 20
- Newly resolved: 5
- Total resolved: 25 / 55
- Remaining: 30

## Handoff
- Tracker pointer updated to this session log.
- Next-session checklist updated with new next-five priorities.
- Research artifact saved:
  - `research-2026-02-17-f031-f032-f033-f035-f043-implementation.md`
